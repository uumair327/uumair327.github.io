"Blur Pencil" is a combination of "Blur" and "Pencil", designed to simplify and easily blur images using a familiar tool like a pencil. By simply dragging and dropping the image on the convenient web interface, the trained Blur Pencil analyzes the image, identifies the objects to be mosaic, and allows you to select and mosaic the desired objects among the recognized objects. It also allows you to save the mosaic-treated image history and share it with other users.

## Overview

An online hackathon (SW development competition) was held at the [Ministry of National Defense Open Source Academy](https://osam.kr/main/index.jsp) (hereinafter referred to as osam). After attending programming courses (web, app, infrastructure, etc.) provided by osam for several months and submitting several documents and algorithm contests, I was selected for the hackathon.

The hackathon, which has been held since 2015, was held for five days, but this time it was changed to online due to the influence of COVID-19. Perhaps because there is only time to develop programs during the evening hours in the military (of course, the perspective varies depending on the unit), the period has been extended to one month. It was a shame because meeting new people and working on projects for several days while staying up all night is the charm of hackathons.

## Introduction Video

## Development

The structure is divided into three main parts: a web front-end using Vue, an express API server to communicate with MongoDB, and a pytorch server to process uploaded images.

I mainly worked on design, server communication, dashboards, and workbenches on the front end. There was not much backend work, as the core mosaic processing is handled by the PyTorch server. Therefore, it seemed manageable to handle it alone, as I only needed to communicate with the database for user and file information. (Of course, considering security and stability, there was no end...)

> You can change the recognition rate and NMS value to change the details of the images to be censored.

This is our core and **workbench** that provides mosaic work. By changing the data values on the right, we communicate with the Flask API server to receive the expected image coordinates to be censored and display those images below.

The advantage of blur pencil is that you can easily mosaic by selecting and deselecting the found images.

## Main Page

Considerable effort was put into the main page. Because the judges need to test it first (of course, after the landing page), since only developers gathered, the design was quite challenging. I referred to many sites, especially Google Drive. At first, I didn't think about the folder and sharing features, but because the dashboard was too dull, I hastily made it during the deadline week. Fortunately, my team members seemed to like it, and I think it was the best thing I did, personally.

## Conclusion

If you are a programming developer in the military, I strongly believe that you should participate in osam without hesitation. Of course, there may not be much time, and there may be many other things to do, but the opportunity to legally code within the military is quite rare.

Above all, although the hackathon was held online in 2020 due to COVID-19, if it is held offline again in the future, the fact that you are absent from your unit for a whole week due to the hackathon is a huge advantage (very important haha). Moreover, if you win, you may receive vacation or prize money.

There is a mid-term algorithm exam, but the difficulty level is really easy. However, it may be a bit difficult to participate in
