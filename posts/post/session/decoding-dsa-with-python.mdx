### Overview

In this session, we will delve into the realm of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) by focusing on one of the fundamental concepts: the stack data structure. We will explore how stacks work, their properties, and their applications in solving coding problems. Specifically, we will tackle the LeetCode problem "Parenthesis Checker" using Python, providing a deep understanding of stack operations and their relevance in DSA.

### Introduction to Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the top of the stack. We will discuss the basic operations of a stack: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.

### LeetCode Problem: Parenthesis Checker

We will solve the LeetCode problem "Parenthesis Checker" using Python and the stack data structure. The problem involves determining whether a given string of parentheses is balanced, meaning each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis in the correct order.

### Understanding Stack Operations

We will dive deep into the implementation of stack operations to solve the Parenthesis Checker problem efficiently. Through code walkthroughs and examples, we will demonstrate how to use stacks to validate the balance of parentheses in a string.

### Key Takeaways

- Understanding the stack data structure and its operations.
- Solving real-world coding problems using stacks, such as the Parenthesis Checker problem.
- Enhancing problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking in Python.

### Conclusion

By the end of this session, participants will have a comprehensive understanding of stacks and their applications in solving DSA problems. They will gain valuable insights into Python programming techniques and be equipped with the knowledge to tackle similar problems on LeetCode and other coding platforms.

Join us in unraveling the mysteries of DSA with Python and mastering the art of problem-solving through practical examples and hands-on learning.
