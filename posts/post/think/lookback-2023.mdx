## Before We Begin

This is my first time writing a year-end reflection post.

I hadn't planned on writing anything special since a reflection post seemed like just a compilation of projects.
However, as I began preparing for job hunting, I found myself reflecting a lot on my past actions and feeling a lot of remorse.
Looking back at the footsteps I've left behind during this time made me realize many things I regret.
It seems that accumulated problems from the past caught up with me, leading to feelings of regret.
I thought to myself, if only I had looked back sooner, if only I had realized earlier, and that's why I'm writing this now.
Rather than a year-end reflection post, this seems more like a retrospective of my development journey so far.

## Huh? I'm a Butterfly ðŸ¦‹

One significant thing happened this year.
I had a meal with my friends with whom I worked.
We talked about the thoughts we had during the project, and looking back, there were some regrets.
At that time, I also opened up about extending the implementation period in the middle of the project.
Although the functionality was implemented, I extended the period without completing it.

> "Because the plan I had in mind changed, I lost interest at that time. Other projects took precedence."

I was very honest about it.
They were friends I had known for a long time, and we had worked together a lot.
Certainly, they were familiar with my personality and habits.

> A: "It's good to pursue interesting things, but what will you do when you enter a company?"

It was a striking remark.

> B: "But you always manage to complete the tasks you need to do thoroughly, distinguishing between personal projects and work at the company."

Another friend defended me, and of course, I've always worked with that level of responsibility and distinction.
However, after the conversation ended casually at that time, I started to think deeply when I got home.
I had never really considered such thoughts, so being asked that question was shocking.

'Did I make a mistake?'

In a way, it made me realize that I had been chasing only enjoyment.
I started programming to find enjoyment, and the process was enjoyable, so I have continued to do it steadily.
However, in the end, chasing after results, I realized that I hadn't filled that void solidly.

## Breathing through Growth

Although I knew the importance of self-branding (I thought I had enough), I feel my competitiveness is sorely lacking.

They say tuna never stops swimming since birth.
If it stops, it can't breathe.
At 24, I want to swim with that mindset.
I'm already looking forward to what thoughts I'll have when I read this post next year.
