## Before We Begin

This is my first time writing a year-end reflection post.

I hadn't planned on writing anything special since a reflection post seemed like just a compilation of projects.
However, as I began preparing for job hunting, I found myself reflecting a lot on my past actions and feeling a lot of remorse.
Looking back at the footsteps I've left behind during this time made me realize many things I regret.
It seems that accumulated problems from the past caught up with me, leading to feelings of regret.
I thought to myself, if only I had looked back sooner, if only I had realized earlier, and that's why I'm writing this now.
Rather than a year-end reflection post, this seems more like a retrospective of my development journey so far.

## Capsule-Render

![cr](/img/2024-1-5-lookback2023/cr.jpg)

Capsule-Render, which can be considered my biggest achievement, reached 1k downloads this time.
Although there's nothing particularly outstanding about its features or structure, I'm really grateful that many people have used and shared it.

When I started developing Capsule-Render, I was in the middle of my military service.
At that time, I had some achievements in entrepreneurship competitions in the military, which allowed me to focus on development by creating a space for it within my unit.
Thanks to that, even though I wasn't a specialist, I was able to freely engage in development activities.
During this time, I came across a post on GitHub about adding a Profile README, a new trend in overseas communities.
Thinking about how to jump on this new trend, I reached the idea of creating dynamic images, leading to the birth of Capsule-Render.

Initially, when I promoted it on overseas communities, there wasn't much response, just one or two reactions here and there.
But then, someone introduced GitHub customization on Velog, and when that post was featured, the number of users increased.
Although I did post on Velog, it quickly disappeared, buried among other posts.
Reflecting on what could have caused such different reactions, I realized it was how the information was presented, the timing of the post, the interest of the community at the time, and the person who posted it, among other factors.
This seems to be true not only for overseas communities but also for domestic ones.
(I'm mentioning this in case it could be helpful for those who want to try something similar.)

## Chzzk-Plus

![chzzkplus](/img/2024-1-5-lookback2023/chzzkplus.jpg)

Recently, with the launch of the streaming platform Chzzk, I quickly developed the related extension [chzzk-plus](https://github.com/kyechan99/chzzk-plus).
As it was still in beta, many users had some complaints about missing features and difficulties in transitioning from other services.

Despite not promoting it separately, the repo's visit traffic hit 7k on the first day, and after releasing it to the market (20 days after publication), it surpassed 4K actual users.

Although I hadn't developed extensions for a while and had even written posts about it, I was able to boldly tackle it.
Of course, it wasn't particularly difficult, and the principles of extension development hadn't changed during that time, but recording such experiences definitely has its benefits.

## Huh? I'm a Butterfly ðŸ¦‹

One significant thing happened this year.

![deskit](/img/2024-1-5-lookback2023/deskit.jpg)
Desk-IT project ended, and I had a meal with my friends with whom I worked.
We talked about the thoughts we had during the project, and looking back, there were some regrets.
At that time, I also opened up about extending the implementation period in the middle of the project.
Although the functionality was implemented, I extended the period without completing it.

> "Because the plan I had in mind changed, I lost interest at that time. Other projects took precedence."

I was very honest about it.
They were friends I had known for a long time, and we had worked together a lot.
Certainly, they were familiar with my personality and habits.

> A: "It's good to pursue interesting things, but what will you do when you enter a company?"

It was a striking remark.

B: "But you always manage to complete the tasks you need to do thoroughly, distinguishing between personal projects and work at the company."

Another friend defended me, and of course, I've always worked with that level of responsibility and distinction.
However, after the conversation ended casually at that time, I started to think deeply when I got home.
I had never really considered such thoughts, so being asked that question was shocking.

'Did I make a mistake?'

In a way, it made me realize that I had been chasing only enjoyment.
I started programming to find enjoyment, and the process was enjoyable, so I have continued to do it steadily.
However, in the end, chasing after results, I realized that I hadn't filled that void solidly.

![lostwak](/img/2024-1-5-lookback2023/lostwak.jpg)

Lostwak, completed in early January.

At a time when I should have decided on a career path in web development and solidified my skills, I unexpectedly developed a fan game.
It was a really long period, over six months, during which I poured my time into it, leaving behind other studies or activities.
I poured all my strength into it, thinking I should finish what I started, but within that, I began to question whether I should have poured so much.
Who would notice even if I did all this? If I hadn't even questioned that, it would be a lie.
External activities, web studies, blog writing, everything came to a halt, and even what I wrote on applications wasn't particularly meritorious.
I don't regret it or lament it.
It was a meaningful experience, and I am truly satisfied with the actions I took.
I wonder if I can handle such experiences when I enter employment.

> If I had adjusted the timing and duration a bit more,

Not just Lostwak, but other projects as well.
Looking at my recent code, I realized that design work was more prevalent than technical considerations or improvements.
Rather than deeply studying to achieve something, I prioritized quickly creating something because I wanted to achieve something immediately.
It was a problem I should have thought about earlier...

Although it's a bit late to say this now,
I started studying and organizing with the mindset of learning from the beginning recently.
But strangely enough, I find this interesting as well.
Fortunately, I seem to have found new enjoyment in it, and I feel good these days.

## Blog

I revamped my blog this time.
After making it with Jekyll and leaving it for about three and a half years, I decided to improve it.
Because there were too many drawbacks when adding new features or improvements,
I switched to Next.js to take advantage of its benefits. Of course, I also studied during that time.
In particular, I boldly changed the irregular post address format, even discarding the paths that were already coming in.
I made efforts for SEO, and I'm excited to see what significant changes there will be compared to before.

I used to think I couldn't write well, and I didn't want to write common posts, but looking back, it was an excuse.
While revisiting the basics, I'm considering writing even mundane or similar posts with the mindset of organizing them internally.

## Breathing through Growth

Although I knew the importance of self-branding (I thought I had enough), I feel my competitiveness is sorely lacking.

About a month ago, I decided to write a retrospective post,
and as I've been gathering my thoughts since then, it may seem like a reflection.
They say tuna never stops swimming since birth.
If it stops, it can't breathe.
At 24, I want to swim with that mindset.
I'm already looking forward to what thoughts I'll have when I read this post next year.
